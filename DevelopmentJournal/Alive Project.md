The theme for this project is 'Alive' so I came up with a couple of initial ideas. One of the ideas was a simplified farming game where you would keep plants or crops alive. My second idea was an fps style game where you would have to continuously kill enemies in order to stay alive. However, since it was my first time making a game in Unreal, I thought these might be a bit too complicated, especially the farming game. I decided to go for a game where the player would be stuck in a building with monsters, trying to stay alive whilst looking for the exit.

## Research

### What sources or references have you identified as relevant to this task?

- What type of sources did you identity and want to explore? How would you justify it in reference to the brief set? Think about the focus of the brief.
- What type of sources do you want to avoid? How could these kinds of sources be detrimental to the user experience, immersion or implementation?

I wanted to look at some video games to get inspiration for my game, specifically some stealth or chase scenes in horror games. A couple games that came to mind were Outlast and Resident Evil Village which have many tense chase/stealth scenes.

# Example

As I have done research regarding the audio identity and developing audio assets for this project in previous formative assignments. I wanted to look into specific Unreal and Wwise systems that will help create a more immersive experience. I wanted to focus on official documentation to improve my ability to learn new techniques without explicit instructions.

I also wanted a creative source to help develop the parachute audio assets and learn how it should function within the game’s narrative.
```

#### Sources

- An opening paragraph about the source stating the author, developer or organisation, this paragraph should explain the source's influence, credentials, critical reception, awards, reputation or any issues with the source. For example, if the source is not reputable. If the source is a game, the issues that occurred during development or if had a poor launch.
- List the aspects analysed in reference to the current task.
- An ending paragraph stating what you enjoyed or disliked, what you agreed with or not agree with.

# Example Documentation

I wanted to create an emitter which takes advantage of spread and focus, which was a technique I learned from a previous assignment where the spatialisation of an object changes depending on distance. I also wanted to work specifically with a `Spline Component` to encapsulate the entire ship with an “Ocean Emitter”. This led me to read the Unreal Blueprints API References and Wwise 3D Positioning documentation (Unreal Engine Blueprint API Reference | Unreal Engine 5.4 Documentation | Epic Developer Community, s.d., AudioKinetic Inc, s.d.).

I found a Blueprint node called “Find Location Closest to World Location" which returns a `Vector3` on the spline position closest to another `Vector3`, I believe this can help move the emitter towards the player(Finding time of given results from (Find Location Closest to World Location) from Splines - Programming & Scripting / Blueprint, 2023).

I found the Unreal documentation clear and easy to navigate, however it was much harder to find specific nodes unless you are familiar with the naming conventions used by Unreal, such as “World Location” and the API documentation is separated from the property references. The Wwise documentation on the other hand is much easier to navigate as they have core topics such as “Using Sounds and Motion to Enhance Gameplay” and examples of how they can be applied, which the unreal documentation lacked. 

# Example Game Source

Just Cause 3 is an action-adventure game developed by Avalanche Studios, it features a mechanic where the player can navigate the open world with the use of a parachute and a wingsuit(Just Cause 3, 2015).

The wind becomes more prominent in the mix and its volume and speed is based on the player's velocity when using the wingsuit or parachute. It is not too overwhelming during action sequences to ensure audio responses can be clearly heard.

I found their implementation and choice great for the context of their narrative and game mechanics. However, for the sequences featured in the assignment, it is more “cinematic” allowing for a different approach for the mix and can be “exaggerated” to drive its narrative function.

## Implementation

### What was the process of completing the task? What influenced your decision making?

- What was the process of completing the task at hand? Did you do any initial planning?
- Did you receive any feedback from users, peers or lecturers? How did you react to it?

<br>

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
public class HelloWorld : MonoBehaviour 
{
    public void Start() 
    {
        Debug.Log("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

### What creative or technical approaches did you use or try, and how did this contribute to the outcome?

- Did you try any new software or approaches? How did the effect development?

### Did you have any technical difficulties? If so, what were they and did you manage to overcome them?

- Did you have any issues completing the task? How did you overcome them?

#####Door
- opened too quick so I used a lerp node instead of setting my rotation inside of my door timeline 
- only set relative rotation
- doors were opening the opposite way so I added a multiply by -1 to the right door

#####Interact prompt
- was too low down and player couldn't see it so i changed the 'space' to world instead of screen as my message doesnt need to appear in a 360 around the door
- text was always shown so i had to set the initial visibility to off

#####Enemy footsteps
-DONT WORK

## Outcome

Here you can put links required for delivery of the task, ensure they are properly labelled appropriately and the links function. The required components can vary between tasks, you can find a definative list in the Assessment Information. Images and code snippets can be embedded and annotated if appropriate.

## Critical Reflection

### What did or did not work well and why?

- What did not work well? What parts of the assignment that you felt did not fit the brief or ended up being lacklustre.
- What did you think went very well? Were there any specific aspects you thought were very good?

### What would you do differently next time?

- Are there any new approaches, methodologies or different software that you wish to incorporate if you have another chance?
- Is there another aspect you believe should have been the focus?

# General Tips

- Use plenty of images and videos to demonstrate your point. You can embed YouTube tutorials, your own recordings, etc.
- Always reference! Even documentation, tutorials and anything you used for your assignment. Use an inline reference for the sentence and a bibliography reference at the end.
- Word count is not important, you can also chose to use bullet points. As long as it is clear and readable, the format your decide to use can be flexible.
- You are free to use AI but please ensure you have made a note in the declared assets, for example if you have a script called Test.cs , you should note that AI was used to in the creation of this script. You can use a bullet point list for each asset used like:

The following assets were created or modified with the use of GPT 4o:
- Test.cs
- AnotherScript.cs
- Development Journal.html

```
