## Research

### What sources or references have you identified as relevant to this task?


For my research I started off with Unreal Documentation as that is the engine I am using, and I have previously used lerp in Unity so it will be good to compare in Unreal.

I also like to include a more visual source which helps me personally understand and absorb the information more easily, although I have to be careful to make sure the source is reliable and up to date.



#### Sources


My task consisted of using the Lerp node to blend between two values so I wanted to research Lerp and how it works within Unreal. Although I didn't find a dedicated documentation to Lerp, I found a document about Math Material Expressions which had a section on Linear Interpolation (Math Material Expressions in Unreal Engine | Unreal Engine 5.5 Documentation | Epic Developer Community, s.d.).

The documentation does quite a good job at explaining Lerp in a fairly simple way, saying the Lerp expression blends two input values based on a third 'mask' value which controls the mix between the two inputs. When the alpha value is 0.0 only the first input is shown, and when the alpha value is 1.0 only the second input is shown. Values between 0.0 and 1.0 create a blend of the two inputs. 

I found the Unreal documentation very helpful despite it being quite short, it was to the point and explained how Lerp works. It also included a screenshot of Blueprints which showed the Lerp node and how to use it within your material which could help me with my task for the week.

# Example Documentation


I found the Unreal documentation clear and easy to navigate, however it was much harder to find specific nodes unless you are familiar with the naming conventions used by Unreal, such as “World Location” and the API documentation is separated from the property references. The Wwise documentation on the other hand is much easier to navigate as they have core topics such as “Using Sounds and Motion to Enhance Gameplay” and examples of how they can be applied, which the unreal documentation lacked. 

# Example Game Source

Just Cause 3 is an action-adventure game developed by Avalanche Studios, it features a mechanic where the player can navigate the open world with the use of a parachute and a wingsuit(Just Cause 3, 2015).

The wind becomes more prominent in the mix and its volume and speed is based on the player's velocity when using the wingsuit or parachute. It is not too overwhelming during action sequences to ensure audio responses can be clearly heard.

I found their implementation and choice great for the context of their narrative and game mechanics. However, for the sequences featured in the assignment, it is more “cinematic” allowing for a different approach for the mix and can be “exaggerated” to drive its narrative function.

- What did not work well? What parts of the assignment that you felt did not fit the brief or ended up being lacklustre.
- What did you think went very well? Were there any specific aspects you thought were very good?

### What would you do differently next time?

- Are there any new approaches, methodologies or different software that you wish to incorporate if you have another chance?
- Is there another aspect you believe should have been the focus?

# General Tips

- Use plenty of images and videos to demonstrate your point. You can embed YouTube tutorials, your own recordings, etc.
- Always reference! Even documentation, tutorials and anything you used for your assignment. Use an inline reference for the sentence and a bibliography reference at the end.
- Word count is not important, you can also chose to use bullet points. As long as it is clear and readable, the format your decide to use can be flexible.
- You are free to use AI but please ensure you have made a note in the declared assets, for example if you have a script called Test.cs , you should note that AI was used to in the creation of this script. You can use a bullet point list for each asset used like:

The following assets were created or modified with the use of GPT 4o:
- Test.cs
- AnotherScript.cs
- Development Journal.html
